# Easy r.avaflow web application
This project is created with the aim of helping scientists and researchers in the field of earth sciences (geomorphology, glaciology, debris flow studies) to work with the modeling of debris flows, avalanches, or lahars.

The essence of the project is to enable a user, who may not have sufficient IT skills such as working with a terminal and installing and configuring necessary dependencies, to work with a program that has a user-friendly and understandable GUI/UI. In other words, complete automation of the installation and configuration of all required dependencies of GRASS GIS and the main extension r.avaflow.

The ultimate goal of the project is to compile a binary file that will install and run a Docker image with all installed dependencies, as well as deploy a web application with an interface inside Docker, which will process user input and send it for execution to the r.avaflow extension of GRASS GIS.

# About r.avaflow
